# To Do List for showPrimes.py

-> Pull from these fixes/features those that should be in 
   the first deployed version [marked with "+"]

Fixes:

	+ Fix gap counting: e.g. in the range 78-80, there is one
	  prime: 79. We say that 79 is a twin prime because when we
	  get to it, our gap size variable is equal to one. We need 
	  to not start accumulating the gap size value until we hit
	  the first prime in the range.

	+ Don't show gap stats in table title when # primes in range is 0 or 1

Refactor/Improve:

	- ?Use st tables instead of html tables?

	- Replace existing prime/composite generation code:
	  . Write one function: given a range, returns a list
	  . the list is a compressed version of the primes and 
	    composites in that range.
	  . e.g. given 15 to 20, the result is
	    15, 16, 17p, 18, 19p, 20
	    and this might be returned as:
	    [2, -17, 1, -19, 1]
	  . Then the code that called this new function would
	    use the result to format & display a table or a plot.

New Features:

	- Add option to download tables as PDFs

	- Center the "download plot" button

	- Add title to whole page

	- ? Add "info" popup window or maybe an about-this-page page?

	- Add an option to show table/plot of gaps between twin prime pairs

	- Add an option to show table/plot of frequency of gap sizes

	- Add an option to show occurances of gap size plateaus
	  (for primes or for twin prime pairs) e.g. bar chart showing 
	  number of width n plateaus for all n sized plateaus that 
	  occur in the given range

	- Add an option to show stats for a series of ranges.
	  e.g. avg gap from 1-100,000 in steps of 1,000 or
	  % of primes in ranges of 100 from 1 to 100,000

√ Don't display a plot of gaps when # primes in range is 0 or 1,
  display a modal message instead.

√  Handle case where there are no primes, or only one
  √ plot of gaps: show msg: 
  	1. √ There is only 1 prime in the range a-b, so no prime gaps to plot
  	2. √ There are no primes in the range a-b, so no prime gaps to plot
  √ table:
    1. √ Don't show gap count if only one prime in the range
    2. √ If only 1 prime, say "prime" not "primes"
    3. √ If only 1 prime (and at least 1 twin pair), fix commas and spaces in title

√+ Fix submit button, when range value(s) have changed, need 
  to click the button twice.

√+ Don't show negative numbers in submit button

√+ Try making primes blue, twin prime pairs bold (or italic) blue

√- Eliminate comma_format function

√+ Cleanup table title

√+ Add title to plot

x Move submit button into the sidebar

x Validate inputs
	x Numbers must be integers
	x b > a

x Rename variables: separations -> gaps

x Move controls to left side panel

x Eliminate columns for controls

x Clean up title on tables
